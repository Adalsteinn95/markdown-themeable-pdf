Themeable markdown to PDF converter
===================================

##### This [Atom package](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-themeable-pdf) converts / prints / exports your markdown files simple and pretty to PDFs.

The package was created to help in the daily work with manuals for customers. Many people are not familiar with Markdown or Github, Bitbucket, ... and thus obtained a widespread PDF from developers. **Important here is that the PDF looks good and professional**. This [Atom package](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-themeable-pdf) tries to ask about this task.

> If you find this module **useful** - or if you find **errors** - please send me your [feedback](https://github.com/cakebake/markdown-themeable-pdf/issues/new). :)
