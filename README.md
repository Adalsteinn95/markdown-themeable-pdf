Themeable markdown converter (Print to PDF, HTML, JPEG or PNG)
==============================================================

##### This [Atom package](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-themeable-pdf) converts / prints / exports your markdown file simple and pretty to `PDF`, `HTML`, `JPEG` or `PNG` format.

The package was created at the beginning to help in the daily work with manuals for customers. Many people are not familiar with Markdown and they will now receive a well-formatted PDF from their developers. **Important here is that the document looks good and professional**. This [Atom package](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-themeable-pdf) tries to ask about this task.

> If you find this module **useful**, you find **errors**, or you have **suggestions** - please send me your [FEEDBACK](https://github.com/cakebake/markdown-themeable-pdf/issues/new) - feel free to **CONTRIBUTE**. Keep in mind that this plugin is under active development. :)

### Installation

Search in atom under **Settings View -> Install -> Packages** the package `markdown-themeable-pdf` and start the installation.

### Usage

The PDF can be generated in various ways:

-	Right-click in the editor area when a file is opened (and saved) and select `Markdown to PDF` **or**
-	Press `ctrl-shift-E` (E = Export) in the editor area when a file is opened (and saved)

#### Page breaks

You can start any time a new PDF page with typing Snippet/Shortcode `page-break` in your markdown editor. So you can prevent such ugly breaks in lists or other contiguous areas.

#### Custom CSS

The package creates a CSS file `~/.atom/markdown-themeable-pdf/styles.css` in your atom configuration directory. You can use this file to customize everything. If you want to change the path, you can change it in the package settings.

### Todo

-	Fix: Open Markdown Preview with `ctrl-shift-M`, right-click in markdown-preview area and select `Save As PDF`
-	Custom header and footer
-	Better handling of long code lines
-	Solving local paths within html code (Image src, ...)
-	Font Awesome integration
-	Emojis
-	Inline Links (Anchors)

### Known Issues

-	**Table header glitches when a table starts directly on a new page**

	When that happens, you can put in your markdown in front of the table an html code `<div class="page-break" />` to prevent this.
